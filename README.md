This project designs and implements an XGBoost trading algorithm (PT2) in the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) environment.
# BSE_XGBOOSTV6_5_parallel.py
This is the final script with the PT2 XGBoost trader correctly implemented in BSE. This script runs multiple BSE simulations in parallel with the number of sims specified by the user.
# BSE_XGBOOSTV6.5_synwithnewfeatures.py
This is a non-working snippet which comments the entire PT2 XGBoost trader implementation in BSE.
# XGB_model_train_new_feat_syn.py
This script trains the XGBoost Model - optimising hyperparameters and training on 2 years of synthetic BTC/USD data.
# btc_usd_5min_30day_BSE.csv
This is teh historical BTC/USD data which is used to create the live time series within BSE.
# synthetic_btc_2year.csv
